#PyBrain is an open-source library for python that is used for machine learning. 
#It allows the user to build neural networks to train and test algorithms to deal with datasets. 
#It interfaces with Mathplotlib for data visualizations. 
#The advantages include use of creation of simple feed forward networks, itâ€™s ease of use, and modular design. 
#Limitations include slow performance with larger data sets and more complex data sets.

!pip install pybrain
!pip install numpy
!pip install scipy
